Product Import Templates
-------------------------

Files in this directory are sample templates used to prepare bulk product imports.

- products-template.xlsx : Excel workbook containing Products, Variants, and Images sheets populated with sample rows.
- products-template.csv  : CSV version of the products sheet.
- product-variants-template.csv : CSV for variant rows related to the main product sheet.
- product-images-template.csv  : CSV for associating images with products.

Copy these files before editing so you always retain a pristine template. Keep column headings unchanged.
